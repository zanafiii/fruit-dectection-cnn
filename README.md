# fruit-dectection-cnn
This is my machine learning model to detect images and find what the most accurate prediction of three possibilities answer: Apple, Orange, and Banana.
I am using Convolutional Neural Network as a Deep Learning Model for predict the image.

Note: this model can just predict apple, orange, and banana. If you scan another image outside of these 3, the program still predict the nearest possibility based on data.
